==========================

These are the requirements for making custom items with Unreal Engine and the Modding Kit.

Visual Studio
-------------

Download `Visual Studio <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/>`_ 2017 or higher.

When running the installer, on the "Workloads" page make sure you select the following:
* "Desktop & Mobile > Desktop development with C++"
* "Gaming > Game development with C++".

If Visual Studio is already installed you can run the installer and press modify to add the
necessary workloads.


Unreal Engine 4
---------------

Open Epic Games launcher and go to "Unreal Engine" tab. 

Next go to Library and add a new engine version. 

Select 4.23.x where x can be any number, and press install.

Modding Kit
-----------

To develop your mods you will need a modkit which can be downloaded from 
`this link <https://github.com/AstroTechies/ModdingKit>`_.

If you are familiar with version control software you should clone it for easier updates.


Wwise (optional)
----------------

Astroneer uses Wwise as its sound engine. If you want to make mods which play sounds you need to install Wwise.

Go to `Wwise <https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/products/wwise>`_ website and head to ``Get Wwise`` -> ``Download Wwise``.

If you don't already have an account, create one. After wwise installed has finished downloading, open it and select WWISE in the top bar.

Click on latest and change it to ``All`` > ``2019.1`` > ``2019.1.8.7173`` and press install. Once presented with options select these:

* Packages

    * Authoring

    * SDK (C++)

* Deployment Platforms

  * Apple

      * macOS

  * Microsoft

      * Windows

      * Visual Studio 2017

      * Visual Studio 2019


After it has finished installing go to ``Unreal Engine`` tab in the top bar. There press on the burger menu and ``Browse For Project``.

Select ``Astro.uproject`` in the file picker. 

Now press ``Integrate WWise into project``. Here select ``All`` > ``2019.1`` > ``2019.1.8.7173``.

In the wwise project path field press on the triangle on the right side and click ``New``.

Now press the ``Integrate`` button.

Generating project files
-------------------------

To generate the project files we will need to run the following command:

.. code-block:: 

    "UE_INSTALL_PATH\Engine\Binaries\DotNET\UnrealBuildTool.exe" -projectfiles -project="PATH_TO_PROJECT\\Astro.uproject" -game -rocket -progress


Open cmd (Press Windows Key + Type "CMD") in your project directory and copy this inside cmd. Remember to replace **UE_INSTALL_PATH** with your unreal engine installation folder which is usually found at ``C:\\Program Files\\Epic Games\UE_4.23\\``.

And remember to change **PATH_TO_PROJECT** with path to the modkit.

Example:

.. code-block:: 

    "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.23\Engine\Binaries\DotNET\UnrealBuildTool.exe" -projectfiles -project="C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\AstroneerModding\\ModdingKit-Master\\Astro.uproject" -game -rocket -progress

Run the command, and then open the ``Astro.uproject`` file and if it asks to build unbuilt modules press yes and wait.
Please Note. Before running the command in CMD, make sure that Visual Studio has been installed along with it's Wordload modules.

You can now start with :doc:`kitModding`.
